# Spectrograph
 using fft and shaders with a lot of parameters for hours of fun

# How to
1. Add a music track to Assets folder.
2. drag the track in the object named TrackHere in SampleScene and link it to the audio source
3. From ShaderPresets folder either choose one of the presets of Experiment material and link it to 
the ShaderHandler Script in ChangeMaterialHere gameobject.
4. play with the sliders
5. ....
6. Profit

* the sliders for the material have horrible names and its some of those variables despite names
that sometimes make sense are still used in multiple places... All symptons of just having fun with an
artist friend on a saturday. Will come back to it and clean it up in the future
